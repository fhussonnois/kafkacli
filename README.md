=============================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fhussonnois/kafkacli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fhussonnois/kafkacli)
[![GoDoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-GoDoc-blue.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/fhussonnois/kafkacli)

[Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) is a high-throughput, distributed, publish-subscribe messaging system.

##  Requirements
------------

1. [Kafka 0.9.0.* or latest releases](http://kafka.apache.org/downloads.html)
2. [Confluent 3.0.* or latest releases](https://www.confluent.io/download/)

## How to build project ?

[Go Lang](https://golang.org/doc/install) must be installed in order to build the project.

You can used the command ```go get``` can be used to retrieve and build the project directly from GitHub.

```bash
go get github.com/fhussonnois/kafkacli/cmd/...
```

The script ```./release.sh``` can be used to package project tar.gz for all OS/architectures.

## Setting defaults Host/Port for use by the CLI

Setting your host/port for use by the CLI tools can be done in a number of ways, here are some approaches:

* Set the HOST and PORT environment variables.

  To set these variables on Linux, macOS, or Unix, use export:

  ```
  export SCHEMA_REGISTRY_HOST=your_schema_registry_host
  export SCHEMA_REGISTRY_PORT=your_schema_registry_port
  ```

  ```
  export KAFKA_CONNECT_HOST=your_kafka_connect_host
  export KAFKA_CONNECT_PORT=your_kafka_connect_port
  ```

* Set the HOST and PORT in the CLI profile properties file on your local system, located at:
  * ~/.kafkacli/host on Linux, macOS, or Unix

  This file should contain lines in the following format:
  ```
  # Kafka Connect
  kafka_connect_host = your_kafka_connect_host
  kafka_connect_port = your_kafka_connect_port

  # Schema Registry
  schema_registry_host = your_schema_registry_host
  schema_registry_port = your_schema_registry_port
  ```
* Set the HOST and PORT while specifying command to run :

The CLI commands accept both arguments `-host` and `-port`

## Kafka Connect CLI
